<h1> GetMoving! Privacy Policy </h1> <br>

<p><b> What does this privacy policy cover? </b></p><br>
<p> This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of the GetMoving! website. Companies acquired by GetMoving! may operate under their own privacy policies. We also provide additional privacy-related information for certain GetMoving! sublinks. Please also see the GetMoving! Terms of Use and any additional Terms of Use or Product License Agreements that may apply to the website or application you are using. </p><br>
<br>
<p><b> What information does GetMoving! collect about its users? </b></p><br>
<p> Your privacy is crucial for us. That is why no information is revealed to other users unless your consent was specifically asked for. In order to avoid virtual identities, each client is asked for his/her credit card number, regardless of the fact that it is an institution or a private individual. The online banking transaction is done through a secure medium: PayPal, so you needn't worry about fraud. We also have a ranking system that states user trustworthiness. By these means, the GetMoving! team ensures security and community awareness at a low cost. </p><br>
<p> When you register to use the GetMoving! website, create an ID, or contact us for support or other offerings; GetMoving collects information that identifies you! This may include your name, company name, email address, or payment information. We may also sometimes collect other information that does not identify you, such as your job title or industry. Some of this information is required and other information is optional. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners[e.g. Facebook profile], in accordance with applicable law. For example, from these sources, we may learn the company size and industry of our industrial customers.</p><br>

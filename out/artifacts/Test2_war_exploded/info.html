    <p>
        <em>
            disability, disabled:
        </em>
        General term used for functional limitations that inhibit one or more of the major life
        activities such as walking, lifting, learning, breathing, etc. When referring to a disabled individual,
        do not specify the disability unless it is pertinent to the story. If it is, it is best to use "people
        first" language or to be specific.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            The writer, who has a disability,.. (Not: The disabled writer...)
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Preferred: The writer, who was born with cerebral palsy,... (specify the actual condition)
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Avoid the use of
        <em>handicap</em> and <em>handicapped</em>, which is now limited to describing laws and situations, e.g., <em>handicapped parking</em>.

    <h3>SNCF: Clients with disabilities</h3>

    <p>
        Prepare your departure without moving! You just have to reserve your seat in the train and pay online. Afterwards, the ticket
        will be loaded on your fidelity card or you will receive it by mail at your doorstep.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are travelling in a wheelchair, with a guiding dog or with another person, you have a dedicated space for you and for the person
        accompanying you. You also fully benefit from the "Access Plus" facilities.
        <strong>The person travelling with you will receive a discount</strong>. So, if you want to offer your newly discovered friend a trip to
        Paris, this is the best way to do it.

    <h3>Disability dance program</h3>
    <p>
        Everyone can dance!  At Dance of the Phoenix, we believe that dance is for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have an open enrollment policy, and students may sign up for any class they are interested in,
        without audition or pre-approval.  We welcome students of all ages, genders, ability levels, and body types.
    </p>

    <p>
        We welcome students with disabilities, including those in manual or power wheelchairs, students using crutches or orthotics,
        and students with developmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and autism.
        <strong>Able-bodied participants are also welcome to join our courses. </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Dancing decreases muscle tension and stress. it boosts self-confidence and helps you find friends while decreasing the
        number of stereotypes towards those who are different.
